### _Features Left to Imlement_
Non so far.

## Testing

- I tested that this game works in different browsers : Chrome , Firefox , Safari . 
- I confirmed that this project is responsive , looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar .
- I confirmed that the reset button works correct.

**Note:** This game has been written with Javascript knowledge I possess at this moment in time. I am, aware that there might be more better ways/functions I could use, so I'm planning on revisiting this at a later stage when I have a better and more in-depth grasp of the subject.


## Bugs
### _Solved Bugs_

1. When I deployed my project on Github page , I discovered there are few errors on console that caused every time the page loads I see the unstyled content for a split-second, then everything settles in. 

- I discovered the flash of unstyled content was  in Firefox only.
I'm not seeing this issue in any other browser that I've tested - IE, Chrome, Opera .. I just add few lines of code on the head of html file. 

        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">
        <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
        <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Spinnaker&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

2. When I deployed my project on Github page , I noticed that there is also another error in console because I had forgotten to add favicon, however this error didnt affect the application proformance but I added it just in case to not have any errors in console.

- I just added this line of code in the head of html file.

        <link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">

### _Unfixed Bugs_

- When I was testing the timer, I noticed that when user go to another tab from the game page in the browser when the game is over and timer round is 0,the timer refreshes and starts over until the timer stops when 30 seconds are up or user click rest game button.  Although this bug does not broken the game work, it is poor in terms of user experience. I could not solve this bug, so I am documenting it here.

![Timer](assets/readMeImage/timerBug.jpg)

- While testing the game on different devices, I realized that the typed letters were not displaying in the input fields on mobile devices. To address this issue, I implemented an event listener for the text input field that ensures the typed letters are correctly displayed in the input fields on mobile devices. However, this solution inadvertently led to a performance issue, as the typed letters were no longer displaying on desktop devices as well. so I documented as unfixed bug.
