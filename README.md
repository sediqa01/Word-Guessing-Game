# Word Guessing Game

# Testing

- I tested that this game works in different browsers : Chrome , Firefox , Safari . 
- I confirmed that this project is responsive , looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar .
- I confirmed that the reset button works correct.

**Note: *** This game has been written with Javascript knowledge I possess at this moment in time. I am, aware that there might be more better ways/functions I could use, so I'm planning on revisiting this at a later stage when I have a better and more in-depth grasp of the subject.
